# ZooMSS ClimateChange

Use ZooMSS to assess the impacts of climate change on the structure of the global zooplankton community, and its role in mediating energy from phytoplankton to fish

## Datasets ##
Annual average surface chlorophyll (chlos) and surface temperature (tos) netcdfs for 
* historical (1950-2014)
* ssp126 (2015-2100), 
* ssp370 (2015-2100) and 
* ssp585 (2015-2100) climate simulations 

## Earth System Models Used
* CESM2, 
* GFDL-ESM4, 
* IPSL-CM6A-LR, 
* MPI-ESM1-2HR and 
* UKESM1-0-LL earth system models. 

Required runs
For each dataset, we need to complete these runs:
1)	The standard model run, with all groups included â€“ COMPLETED
2)	A run with salps and larvaceans removed (no filter feeders)
3)	A run with carnivorous copepods, chaetognaths and jellyfish removed (no carnivores)
4)	A run with omnivorous copepods and euphausiids removed (no omnivores)
5)	A run with one zooplankton group
6)	A run with three zooplankton groups.
